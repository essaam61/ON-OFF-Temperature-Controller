Developed and configured a simple ON-OFF temperature controller application based on FreeRTOS Multitasking Kernel approach. It was applied on Arm Cortex M4 Tiva C EVB using FreeRTOS along with its techniques by Keil IDE utilizing C programming language.
An ON-OFF temperature controller, will turn OFF the heater/oven (a buzzer becomes active) whenever the temperature is above a pre-defined setpoint  (i.e., the required value).. Similarly, if the temperature is below the setpoint then the heater is turned ON.
